# An alternative to Iconify website

Since the Iconify website is not very user-friendly, I decided to create a simple alternative to it. This project is a simple Vue 3 application that uses the Iconify API to fetch icons and display them in a user-friendly and compact way.

Visit the live version of the project: [ic.tirsik.net](https://ic.tirsik.net).

For now, I implemented features that I need. If you have any feature requests, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
